Snakepit is an experiment in genetic algorithms.

Snakes traverse a 2D grid in search for food and sometimes lay eggs. Each time a snake moves, it consumes energy. If energy reaches zero, the snake will die and leave behind some food. Snakes can consume the following types of food:

Green - Replenishes large amount of energy AND increases length of snake.
Blue - Replenishes small amount of energy AND decreases length of snake.
Red - Drains a small amount of energy.
Each of the snakes have genes which control the following attributes:

Attraction to GREEN, BLUE and RED food
Attraction to other snakes
Egg laying rate
When a snake lays an egg, its DNA is passed down to the child with a small chance of mutation. Snakes with good genes are more likely to survive longer and therefore lay more eggs.
